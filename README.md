# Guidelines

This project is organized by using elements of [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)).

It is based on the four values:

* Commitment

* Focus

* Openness

* Respect

* Courage

## Definition of Done

We say a task (sprint item) is done if 

* It is reviewed by one of the team members.

* It is documented either in the technical or the user documentation.

## Task Management

There are three different types of tasks which are depicted in the following figure:



* The main vision is represented in Epics. Epics are not definied in detail and can change in future. 
  Those can be found in the Github Repository. They are created by the product owner.

* Backlog items that must be refined are defined as GitHub projects. Those items must be discussed with the developer teams in order to prepare tasks for the next sprint.

* Sprint items are tasks that are defined as small and independent as possible.
