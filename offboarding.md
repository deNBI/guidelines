  * FORC api key (staging/ development)
  * HAProxy password (staging)
  * HAProxy password (production)

  * denbi-portal-backup (myCeBiTec ThinLinc)
  * if applicable: Elixir projects (joined as support)
 
 ### Tickets
 * try to finish all tickets
 * if open tickets remain, it should be clear how to proceed
 
 ### Knowledge Monopoly
 * check that if there is some information only the leaving team member has, that it is documented for others, before they leave
 
 ### Miscellaneous
